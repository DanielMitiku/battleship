# Battleship

> Battleship is a game played by a human player against the computer. The player attacks the computer by hitting locations on the computer board and vice versa. The player and computer take turns to attack each other by hitting locations on their opponent's board. If the location holds a ship, the ship is hit. The player who sinks all of their opponent's ships first wins the game.
